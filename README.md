# Fake-News-Detection
This repository contains program of fake news detection we have download news dataset from the internet in which news are labelled as fake and real . I have used some algorithm like  tfidfvectorizer, PassiveAggressive Classifier.

## What is fake news and how we are going to tackle this?
In recent years, with the advent of the Internet, social media has become increasingly commonplace in many parts of the world. These events have led to an increase in the popularity and spread of false stories. Consistent manifestation of fake news on T.V channels and the internet became a trend today. In this regard, efforts have been made to facilitate the process of obtaining false information. We present a concept that combines mathematical, neural and neighboring networks with external factors so that we can provide an efficient solution. The objective of this project is to create a tool for finding language patterns as well assort them into fake or real stories through machine learning and natural language processing. With the help of these tools, we will create an overall solution to this problem. Finally, using these combined features, we will classify headlines both agree, disagree, discuss, or are unrelated.
